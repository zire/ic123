## Node Providers：节点供应商

A node provider (NP) is a non-canister [principal](../P/principal) that receives the rewards stemming from node participation to the [IC](../I/ic) (aka “payout principal”). Usually, though not necessarily, a node provider is the owner of the [node](node), and may also be involved in node operation and related tasks. A node provider may receive rewards from multiple nodes in multiple [data centers](../D/datacenter).
