## Neuron Age：神经元年龄
### 中文释义
**神经元年龄**是一个[神经元](../N/neuron)参数，大致表示它从创建以来或从上次进入[非溶解状态](non-dissolvingstate)以来经过的时间。神经元年龄的计算需要考虑神经元是否已经花时间[溶解](../D/dissolvingstate)还是[已溶解](../D/dissolvestate)，两者都会重置这个参数。
### Wiki Definition
The **neuron age** is a [neuron](../N/neuron) parameter roughly indicative of the time that has passed since its creation or since when it last entered into a [non-dissolving state](non-dissolvingstate). Calculation of a neuron’s age needs to take into account whether the neuron has spent time [dissolving](../D/dissolvingstate) or [dissolved](../D/dissolvestate), both of which reset this parameter.
