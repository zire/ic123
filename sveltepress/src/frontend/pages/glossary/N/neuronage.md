## Neuron Age：神经元年龄

The **neuron age** is a [neuron](../N/neuron) parameter roughly indicative of the time that has passed since its creation or since when it last entered into a [non-dissolving state](non-dissolvingstate). Calculation of a neuron’s age needs to take into account whether the neuron has spent time [dissolving](../D/dissolvingstate) or [dissolved](../D/dissolvestate), both of which reset this parameter.
