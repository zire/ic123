## Neuron：神经元
### 中文释义
**神经元**是[互联网计算机](../I/ic)的实体，可以对互联网计算机平台治理发起提案或对提案进行投票。
为了提供负责任的治理所需的稳定性，神经元需要存储（"质押"）一定量的ICP才能发起提案或对提案进行投票。可以将ICP锁定一段时间之后溶解或者立即[溶解](../D/dissolvingstate)。神经元中质押的ICP存储在神经元帐户中。神经元持有者有权就治理问题发起提案或[投票](../V/voting)，并根据ICP的质押金额和溶解期的长度来获得投票奖励。
### Wiki Definition
A **neuron** is an [IC](../I/ic) entity that can make proposals and vote on proposals related to the governance of the [Internet Computer](../I/ic) platform.<br>

To provide the stability required for responsible governance, neurons need to store ("stake") a certain amount of [ICP](../I/icp) in order to be able to make and vote on proposals. This locks the tokens for a period of time, after which it starts [dissolving](../D/dissolvingstate). The ICP stake of a neuron is stored in a neuron account. The neuron owner has the right to propose and vote on governance issues, and is granted rewards for [voting](../V/voting) in proportion to the amount of ICP staked, and the duration of the [dissolve period](non-dissolvingstate).
