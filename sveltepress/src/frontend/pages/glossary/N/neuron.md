## Neuron：神经元

A **neuron** is an [IC](../I/ic) entity that can make [proposals](../P/proposals) and vote on proposals related to the governance of the [Internet Computer](../I/ic) platform.<br>

To provide the stability required for responsible governance, neurons need to store ("stake") a certain amount of [ICP](../I/icp) in order to be able to make and vote on proposals. This locks the tokens for a period of time, after which it starts [dissolving](../D/dissolvingstate). The ICP stake of a neuron is stored in a neuron account. The neuron owner has the right to propose and vote on governance issues, and is granted rewards for [voting](../V/voting) in proportion to the amount of ICP staked, and the duration of the [dissolve period](non-dissolvingstate).
