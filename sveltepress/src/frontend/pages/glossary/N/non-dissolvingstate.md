## Non-dissolving State：非溶解状态

A [neuron](../N/neuron) that is not [dissolved](../D/dissolvestate) or [dissolving](../D/dissolvingstate) is said to be in a **non-dissolving state** (or "aging"). Non-dissolving neurons thus accrue "age", with the caveat that beginning to dissolve at any time reduces this age back to zero. The dissolve delay parameter of a non-dissolving (aka "aging") neuron cannot be zero, because such a neuron would have to already be dissolved.
