## Query：查询

A **query** is an optimised way to execute operations on a [canister](../C/canisters) where the state changes are not preserved. Queries are synchronous and can be made to any [node](../N/node) that hosts the canister. Queries do not require [consensus](../C/consensus) to verify the result.
