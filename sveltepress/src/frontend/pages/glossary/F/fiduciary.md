## Fiduciary：账号受托者

The **fiduciary** of an [account](../A/account) is the [principal](../P/principal) allowed to make [transactions](../T/transactions) on the account; as such, it may be useful to think of it as the owner of the account, with the caveat that it may or may not be the [beneficiary](../B/beneficiary) of the account. The [neuron account](../N/neuronaccount) is a prominent example of an account for which the beneficiary and fiduciary do not coincide (the fiduciary is the [governance canister](../G/governancecanister) while the beneficiary is the neuron holder). The fiduciary of a (ledger) account does not change over time.<br>

The distinction between fiduciary and beneficiary is also important for DeFi dapps (canisters) that interact with the IC ledger: in this case, the fiduciary is the DeFi canister while the beneficiary is the individual or organisation ([[#principal|principal) that uses the DeFi canister’s services.
