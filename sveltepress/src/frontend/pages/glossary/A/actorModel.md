## Actor Model：参与者模式

An **actor** is a primitive in the Actor Model. It is a process with encapsulated state that communicates with other concurrently running actors through asynchronous messages that are received sequentially. The Actor Model is relevant to the [IC](../I/ic) because [canisters](../C/canisters) on the IC (a type of smart contract) follow the Actor Model for concurrent and asynchronous computation.
