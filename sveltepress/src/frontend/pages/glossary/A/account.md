### 中文释义
帐号是[**分类账本容器**（Ledger Canister）](../L/leadercanister)中的条目组合，是一种智能合约，模仿了常规银行帐户的行为，用[**IC**](../I/ic)的原生设施令牌[**ICP**（Internet Computer Protocol）](../I/icp)作为度量单位。账号由[**主体**（Principal）](../P/principal)拥有，其所有权不会随时间而改变。每个账号都有一个正[余额](../B/balance)，精确到**ICP**小数点后8位。<br>

### Wiki Definition

A ledger account is a set of entries in the [ledger canister](../L/leadercanister), which is a smart contract that mimics the guise and behavior of a regular banking account, whose unit of measure is [ICP](../I/icp) (Internet Computer Protocol) utility tokens. Ledger accounts are owned by [principals](../P/principal), and their ownerships do not change over time. Every account on the ledger has a positive [balance](../B/balance) measured in ICP with a precision of eight decimals. [英文原版链接](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Glossary#account)
