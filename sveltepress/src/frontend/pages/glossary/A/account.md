## Account：账号

A ledger account is a set of entries in the [ledger canister](../L/ledgercanister), which is a smart contract that mimics the guise and behavior of a regular banking account, whose unit of measure is [ICP](../I/icp) (Internet Computer Protocol) utility tokens. Ledger accounts are owned by [principals](../P/principal), and their ownerships do not change over time. Every account on the ledger has a positive [balance](../B/balance) measured in ICP with a precision of eight decimals.
