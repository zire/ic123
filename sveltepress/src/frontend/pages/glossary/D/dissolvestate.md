## Dissolved State：溶解完成状态

The **dissolved state** is a [neuron](../N/neuron) state characterized by a [dissolve delay](dissolvedelay) equal to zero. (It is conventionally said that a neuron in this state does not "have" a dissolve delay.) It is in this state that a neuron can be "disbursed," hence its stake moved elsewhere, and its corresponding [neuron account](../N/neuronaccount) closed. The [age](../N/neuronage) of a dissolved neuron is considered to be zero.
