## Dissolving State：溶解进行状态

A **dissolving state** is a [neuron](../N/neuron) state that follows immediately after its owner issues a "start dissolving" command, and continues until a "stop dissolving" command is issued, or until the dissolve delay timer runs out. The [age of a dissolving neuron](../N/neuronage) is considered to be zero.
