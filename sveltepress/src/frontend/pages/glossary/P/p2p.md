## Peer-to-peer (P2P)：点对点

In common usage, **peer-to-peer** (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions workload across a network of equally-privileged computer [nodes](../N/node) so that participants can contribute resources such as processing power, disk storage, or network bandwidth to handle application workload.<br>

The **peer-to-peer layer** collects and disseminates [messages](../M/messages) and artifacts from users and from other nodes.<br>

The [nodes](../N/node) of a [subnet](../S/subnet) form a dedicated peer-to-peer broadcast network that facilitates the secure **bounded-time/eventual delivery** broadcast of artifacts (such as [ingress messages](../I/ingressmessage), control messages and their signature shares). The [consensus](../C/consensus) layer builds upon this functionality.<br>
