## Proto-node：原初节点

A **proto-node** is an [IC](../I/ic) entity consisting of a combination of hardware and software, that differs from a [node](../N/node) in that it has not yet been registered with the IC. A proto-node is, in short, a "node-in-waiting," hence has all that it takes to be a node except the [replica](../R/replica) software.
