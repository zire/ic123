## Proposal：提案

A **proposal** is a statement describing an action to modify certain parameters of the [IC](../I/ic), or of any of its subsystems. It is implemented as an IC entity having various attributes, such as an ID, a URL, a summary etc. Proposals are submitted by eligible [neuron](../N/neuron) owners for the consideration of the IC community, and undergo a [voting](../V/voting) process, following which they can be adopted or rejected. Adopted proposals are then executed. There are several taxonomies of proposals, the most prominent of which groups proposals into "topics," whose adoption, in turn, triggers certain categories of actions, such as the creation of a [subnet](../S/subnet), the addition of a [nodes](../N/node) to a subnet, and the modification of the [ICP](../I/icp) exchange rate.
