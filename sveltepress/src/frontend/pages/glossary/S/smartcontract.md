## Smart Contract：智能合约

A **smart contract** is a stateful computer program designed to automatically execute, control or document relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. A smart contract can be deployed on the [Internet Computer](../I/ic) in the form of a [canister](../C/canisters) bundling data and code.<br>

A canister can have one or more [controllers](../C/controller) that are permitted to modify the code of the canister, thereby modifying the terms of the smart contract. For a canister smart contract to have immutable code, its list of controllers must be empty.
