## Minting Transaction：铸造交易

A **minting transaction** is the process of "minting" [ICP](../I/icp), whereby a certain amount of ICP comes into existence. ICP is minted in order to reward [neurons](../N/neuron) for [voting](../V/voting), and reward [node providers](../N/nodeprovider) for participating in the IC by providing compute capacity through the running of [nodes](../N/node). A minting transaction is represented as a [transaction](../T/transactions) from the [ICP supply account](../I/icpsupplyaccount) to a destination [account](../A/account).
