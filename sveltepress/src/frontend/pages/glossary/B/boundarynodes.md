The boundary nodes have several purposes: they aid in discover-ability (the ic0.app domain name points to a set of boundary nodes), they are geo-aware and can route incoming requests to the nearest subnet [node](../N/node) that hosts the [canister](../C/canisters) involved, they can help load balance query [transactions](../T/transactions), they can cache cryptographically verified data in the role of a content distribution network, they can throttle excessive interactions from an outside IP address, bootstrapping/Installing the service worker, and they can help protect subnets from DDoS attacks.[英文原版链接](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Glossary#balance#boundary_nodes)
