## Balance：余额
### 中文释义
**余额**是[**账号**](../A/account)中的存款总额减去取款总额。某些情况中，必要时可以说一个不在**账本**中的**账号余额**为零。**账本帐号**的**余额**以包括小数点后八位数的[**ICP**](../I/icp)衡量。一个**账号**的最小**余额**是**0.00000001**或**10^-8** ICP。这个数量有时被称为一个**e8**。

### Wiki Definition
The **balance** of an [account](../A/account) on the ledger is the sum of all deposits minus the sum of all withdrawals. As a degenerate case, it is sometimes useful to say that an account which is not present in the ledger has a balance of zero.
The balance of a ledger account is denominated in ICP and is represented with eight decimals. Thus, the minimum positive balance of an account is 0.00000001 or 10^-8 [ICP](../I/icp); this amount is sometimes referred to as one e8.[英文原版链接](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Glossary#balance)
