## Balance：余额

The **balance** of an [account](../A/account) on the ledger is the sum of all deposits minus the sum of all withdrawals. As a degenerate case, it is sometimes useful to say that an account which is not present in the ledger has a balance of zero.

The balance of a ledger account is denominated in ICP and is represented with eight decimals. Thus, the minimum positive balance of an account is 0.00000001 or 10^-8 [ICP](../I/icp); this amount is sometimes referred to as one e8.
