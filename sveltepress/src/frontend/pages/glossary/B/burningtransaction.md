## Burning Transaction：销毁交易

A **burning transaction** is the process of "burning" [ICP](../I/icp), whereby a certain amount of ICP are destroyed. The main use case is that of purchasing [cycles](../C/cycles), through which ICP are destroyed while at the same time a corresponding amount of cycles is created, using the current exchange rate between ICP and ([SDR](../S/sdr)), in such a way that one SDR corresponds to one trillion (10E12) cycles. It is represented as a [transaction](../T/transactions) from the source [account](../A/account) to the [ICP supply account](../I/icpsupplyaccount).
