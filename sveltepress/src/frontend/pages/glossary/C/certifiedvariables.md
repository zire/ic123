## Certified Variable：可认证变量

A piece of data that a [canister](canisters) can store in its [subnet’s](../S/subnet) canonical state in the processing of an update call (or inter-canister call), so that during the handling of a [query](../Q/query) call, the canister can return a certificate to the user that proves that it really committed to that value.
