## Canister Signature：容器签名

A **canister signature** uses a signature scheme based on [certified variables](certifiedvariables). Public “keys” include a [canister id](canisteridentifier) plus a seed (so that every [canister](canisters) has many public keys); signatures are certificates that prove that the canister has put the signed message at a specific place in its state tree. Details in the The Internet Computer Interface Specification.
