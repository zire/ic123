## Cycles：Cycles

On the [Internet Computer](../I/ic), a **cycle** is the unit of measurement for resources consumed in the form of processing, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. Every canister has a cycles account to which resources consumed by the canister are charged. The Internet Computer’s utility token ([ICP](./../I/icp)) can be converted to cycles and transferred to a canister. Cycles can also be transferred between canisters by attaching them to an [inter-canister] message.<br>

ICP can always be converted to cycles using the current price of ICP measured in [SDR](../S/sdr) using the convention that one trillion cycles correspond to one SDR.
