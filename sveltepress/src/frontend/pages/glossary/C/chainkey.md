## Chain Key Cryptography：链钥密码学

**Chain key cryptography** consists of a set of cryptographic protocols that orchestrate the [nodes](../N/node) that make up the [Internet Computer](../I/ic). The most visible innovation of chain key cryptography is that the Internet Computer has a single public key. This is a huge advantage as it allows any device, including smart watches and mobile phones, to verify the authenticity of artifacts from the Internet Computer.
