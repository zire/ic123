## Consensus：共识
In distributed computing, **consensus** is a fault tolerant mechanism by means of which a number of [nodes](../N/node) can reach agreement about a value or state.<br>

Consensus is a core component of the [replica](../R/replica) software. The consensus layer selects [messages](../M/messages) from the peer-to-peer artifact pool and pulls messages from the cross-network streams of other [subnets](../S/subnet) and organizes them into a [batch](../B/batch), which is delivered to the [message routing](../M/messagerouting) layer.
