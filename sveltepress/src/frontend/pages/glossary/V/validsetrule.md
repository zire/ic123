## Valid Set rule：有效集合规则

The **valid set rule** is the rule that determines a valid [induction pool](../I/inductionpool). [Ingress messages](../I/ingressmessage) and [inter-canister messages](../I/intercanistermessage) must pass certain checks to ensure that the valid set rule is upheld before they can be added to the induction pool.
