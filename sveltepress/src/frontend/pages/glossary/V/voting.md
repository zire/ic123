## Voting：投票

**Voting** is the process through which proposals are selected for adoption and implementation. Its direct participants are the [neurons](../N/neuron), who both (a) submit proposals and (b) vote on proposals. The voting process is a rather intricate undertaking, involving aspects such as neuron eligibility, voting power, chains of neuron followees etc. This has been designed with security and dependability in mind, and is being continuously improved in order to prevent the concentration of voting power in the hands of just a few neuron owners.
