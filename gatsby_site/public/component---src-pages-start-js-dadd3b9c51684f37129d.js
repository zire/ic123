Everyone is talking about it. Every media is tossing around buzzwords like Web3, metaverse as if the future has already arrived and you're going to miss the train. Everyone seems to have strong opinion about it with very divided views. People from different blockchain camps diss each other and everyone thinks his/her chain is the greatest."),a.createElement(d.Z,{className:"entry-one"},"Blockchain is a very complex subject that weaves together sophisticated concepts from economics, investment, finance, mathematics, cryptography, software, Internet, and even sociology.

Everyone in crypto is on Twitter. Social media networks have come and go in the last 20 years, but Twitter has remained to be the best hub for intellectuals and KOLs in tech - it's certainly the largest. Instagram is for photo influencers. Reddit is an acquired taste with too many trolls. Facebook is for birthday reminders. Linkedin is a trainwreck with few new features or improvements in the last ten years. Wechat and Weibo have massive user base but the cost of high-quality information discovery is too high. Most of the original contents nowadays either come from Twitter or can be easily found on Twitter. Try to read the source, not the second-hand Google-translated version."),a.createElement(d.Z,{className:"entry-one"},"Second, when you run into a blockchain project, always ask the question ",a.createElement("b",null,'"Which blockchain is this dApp built on?"'),". Blockchain industry consists of several major tribes - or we call ecosystems. Every ecosystem is built around a Layer-0 or Layer-1 protocol. Each ecosystem has its own legions of crypto funds, developers, node providers, wallets, games, NFT collections, NFT marketplace and decentralized apps (dApps). The embedded technology from the Layer-1 blockchain network dictates how the dApp shall be built, what kind of business model it may adopt and how to do its go-to-market. When a dApp adopts an L-1 blockchain, its growth will follow the rise and fall of the ecosystem of this blockchain. Think about Game of Thrones. You don't fight for two different houses."),a.createElement(d.Z,{className:"entry-one"},"Third, do not make the naive assumption that Ethereum equals blockchain. Ethereum is an influential protocol that has gathered huge amount of assets and almost all the crypto developers and OGs cut their teeth in the early days of Ethereum. However, there are many other blockchain protocols that are growing fast and chipping away the market share of Ethereum. Bitcoin ecosystem still lords over all other blockchains, for becoming the alternative standard of store of value. Ethereum ecosystem is the dominance force where most of the NFT series are minted. Solana, Avalanche, NEAR, Polygon, Algorand, Binance Smart Contract (BSC) follow the footstep (and to varying degree, its code) of Ethereum and try to become a better version of it. Cardano does things in their own way, in hard-mode. Polkadot and Cosmos are Layer-0 networks that try to connect multiple chains. The Internet Computer Protocol (\"ICP\") developed by DFINITY has expanded the boundary of blockchain industry significantly, if not the Internet. Arweave and Filecoin are two major IPFS networks that try to do distributed storage. If you come across an L0/1 blockchain that's not from this list, it's too small to matter (critical mass is important in crypto) or too early to consider (a blockchain protocol becomes meaningful only after launching its mainnet)."),a.createElement(d.Z,{className:"entry-one"},"Fourth, always apply first principle by asking these two questions: 1) ",a.createElement("b",null,'"Who are its customers?"')," and 2) ",a.createElement("b",null,'"What value does it bring to its customers?"'),". This is the only way to validate whether a blockchain protocol or the many dApps built on it can bring value to the society. You will find that many blockchain protocols or dApps are created to support another protocol. In the same vein as you would try to find a natural person through layers of BVI/Cayman entities, keep tracing up the chain until the end customer becomes an average Joe in the street. Try this exercise and see how many dApps/L1 blockchains can actually bring you to a real retail customer Joe or enterprise customer Smith. If such a customer or use-case scenario cannot be found, then this dApp/blockchain is built on layers of mirage. Mirage is rampant in crypto."),a.createElement(d.Z,{className:"entry-one"},"Last, while it's natural to ask a few friends who seem to be closer to the crypto industry to get started, nobody is any wiser and you should do your own research (DYOR) to draw conclusions in your own method. It's extremely difficult, if not impossible, to find a neutral voice in this industry. People are often too knee-deep in a camp already to tell you something objective - including myself. Read the white paper, conduct due dilligence on the team, observe how they conduct themselves on Twitter. Only after you commit sufficient time and effort to do this research with brutal intellectural honesty, the path to truth or faith (always in relative terms in crypto) may then reveal itself to you."),a.createElement(d.Z,{className:"entry-three"},"3.
