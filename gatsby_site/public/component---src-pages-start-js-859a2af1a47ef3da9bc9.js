Everyone in crypto is on Twitter. After 20 years of social media, Twitter has now become the one and only place for intellectuals and KOLs in tech - it's certainly the largest. Instagram is for photo influencers. Reddit is an acquired taste with too many trolls. Facebook is for birthday reminders. Linkedin is a broken trainwreck where all the cool kids have already got off - it smells stale and looks utterly uninteresting. Reduce your time on local language site such as WeChat or Weibo to the minimum - they do have massive user base but generally have very, very low quality content that's not much better than opium. All the original content comes from Twitter. Try to read the source, not the second-hand Google-translated version."),o.a.createElement(p.a,{className:"entry-one"},"Second, when you run into one blockchain project after another, always ask the question ",o.a.createElement("b",null,'"Which lockchain is this dApp built on?"'),". Blockchain industry consists of several major tribes - or we call ecosystems. Every ecosystem is built around a Layer-0 or Layer-1 protocol. Each ecosystem has its own legions of crypto funds, developers, node providers, wallets, games, NFT collections, NFT marketplace and decentralized apps (dApps)."),o.a.createElement(p.a,{className:"entry-one"},"Third, do not make the naive assumption that Ethereum equals Blockchain. Ethereum is an influential protocol that has gathered huge amount of assets and almost all the crypto developers cut their teeth in the early days of Ethereum. However, there are many other blockchain protocols that are growing fast and may threaten the dominance of Ethereum. Bitcoin ecosystem is on its own - it can't do much other than being the store of value. Ethereum ecosystem is the dominance force where most of the NFT series are minted. Solana, Avalanche, NEAR, Polygon, Algorand, Binance Smart Contract (BSC) follow the footstep (and to varying degree, its code) of Ethereum and try to become a better version of Ethereum. Cardano is on their own planet. Polkadot and Cosmos are Layer-0 networks that try to connect multiple chains. The Internet Computer Protocol (\"ICP\") developed by DFINITY has expanded the boundary of blockchain industry significantly. Last but not the least, Arweave and Filecoin are two major IPFS networks that try to do distributed storage.

This is the only way to validate whether a blockchain protocol or the many dApps built on it, can bring value to the society. You will find that many blockchain protocols or dApps are created to support another protocol. Keep tracing up the chain until the end customer becomes the average Joe in the street.
